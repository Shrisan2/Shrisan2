ðŸ‘‹ Hi, My name is Shrisan Kapali. I am a student at the University of Texas at Arlington, currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science
   with the expected graduation date to be December, 2021.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in mobile application developement, cloud hosting, and web development. I also have a keen interest in Machine Learning and 
   Artificial Intelligence and believe one day my contribution towards the AI and ML research will help improve the life of all living beings.
   
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning different software life cycle development tools, project management fundamentals, and actively looking for opportunities 
   to enhance my analytical and problem solving skills.
